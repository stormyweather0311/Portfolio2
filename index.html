    <h2> The Life of a Storm (About me)</h2>
    <p>I was born at March Airforce Base in Washington State in 1992. Both my parents met overseas in the military. Growing up I lived in Washngton State with my mom. Until I was two years old I lived on a farm in Oregon with my grandparents because my mom was deployed in Somolia. When she got out the military I atteneded various private schools in Seattle. Fast foward 18 years and at 20 year old I joined the Marines. I think that is the most important part of my story because it help define to you who I am as a man. I joined the Marines in 2013 as a 0311 Rifleman. My whole entire life I knew I wanted to Join the military, so going into the Marines was everything I was hoping it was going to be. I deployed twice for a total of 17 months during my 4 year contract. I've been to over a dozen countries and trained all over the world. My time in Infantry allowed me to attend many high end special forces schools. I got out of the military in the begining of 2017. After feeling like I had accomplished all I wanted to do in the military, I went to community college for 2 years before realizing nothing in civilian world interested me. I decided that working from home and spending time with family was now most important. After being gone from my paretns and siblings for almost 9 years, I felt the need to come home (Seattle). I reached out to a buddy and he recomended Epicodus and that is how I found myself here.</p>

  <P>Many people ask me what I spend time doing now that I moved back home and out of the Military. So here is a list of my hobbies. I will also include a numbered list of my favorite music artist starting my most favorite. </P>
  <ul>
    <li>Shooting guns and Cleaning my guns</li>
    <li>Spedning time with my family</li>
    <li>Working out</li>
  </ul>
  <ol>
    <li>Jay-Z</li>
    <li>Drake</li>
    <li>Tory Lanez (Don't judge I like his ryhmes)</li>
    <li>Lil Wayne</li>
  </ol>
  
  <p> I think it's always worth mentioning I have many skills! I am certified <strong>combat Marksmenship Intructor, Combat Life Saver certifed,Squadleader and Tactical Small unit graduate</strong>. Ive been to so many courses and trained with a wide variety of forces from Navy SEALS to Royal Marines. My 4 years in the Marines I believe gives me a mental advantage over most because I've gone through some of the hardest challenges life has to offer. I know physically and mentally that less than 1% of the world has gone through my obstacles. <strong>Yet, I remain humble and eager to learn knowing I have much to learn and I am better than no one.</strong></p>

Here's a picture Marines attached to a  <span class="largefont">TRACK</span> Company. You can see them exit the back of the tactical vehicle. A memory I've experienced too many times! Although this picture is old, and the gear and weapons are very outdated this picture makes me laugh.</p>
